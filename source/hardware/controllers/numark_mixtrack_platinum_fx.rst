**2. Overview**

|  The pads are for controlling cue’s, loops, and The Numark Mixtrack
     Platinum FX is a 2 channel (with 4 channel layering) entry level DJ
     controller with an integrated audio interface. The stand out
     feature of the Mixtrack Platinum FX is the LCD displays integrated
     into the jog wheels. It is a USB Audio and MIDI Class compliant
     device and works with Linux, macOS, and Windows.
|
| **3.Audio Interface**
|
| Configure Mixxxs’ Master output for channels 1-2 and Headphones
   output for Channels 3-4.
|
| The microphone input on this controller is not available to the
   computer through the controller’s audio interface. It is mixed with
   the master output in hardware, so this controller’s audio interface
   is not suitable for broadcasting or recording the inputs. If you want
   to use the controller for broadcasting or recording, a separate audio interface with a
   microphone input is suggested.

| **7 Advanced User Section**
|
| For advanced users, alternative functions exist in the code, by
 accessing and setting a code variable.
|
| **TAPPING**
|
| Added logic for the tap button, Two modes exist:
|
| • The default is to use the MIXXX common bpm.tapButton which sets the effective bpm to the one tapped using the
 tempo adjust. Shift tap resets to 0 tempo change.
|
| • The alternative changes the actual file bpm. The problem is the reset doesn't work, the best I can do is change the
 effective bpm to the original, but then the file is still "broken" next time it is loaded. The alternative mode
 is only accessible by setting a code variable MixtrackPlatinumFX.tapChangesTempo to false, recommended only for advanced users.
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

..

| For the default, the MIXXX common function takes taps and averages
 them. If you don't tap for 2 seconds the average resets and you start again. To prevent accidental double taps or misses if a tap is 40%
 shorter or 80% longer it will be ignored. I found while testing
 sometimes if I got the first two taps wrong the rest would be
 rejected by the filter, but it wasn't obvious this was happening. By
 default the button is dimly lit (like most others). When you tap the
 button if it accepts the tap it will go bright, if it rejects it from
 the filter it will show off. If this happens stop tapping wait 2
 seconds for the filter to clear and try again. Fixed this kicking in after 8 taps.
|
| For tapping we have to "guess" which deck is intended, so we use some pointers.
|
| 1.we'll only consider loaded decks
|
| 2.except in fallback we'll only consider decks on the "active" layer (unless neither on this layer are loaded)
|
| 3.If one deck has PFL and the other doesn't we use that one (assumption that tapping bpm will be on a non playout deck)
|
| 4.If both have the same PFL state then look if one is playing. Currently prefers the one that IS playing, could argue this the other way?
|
| 5.If they both match then use the one with the lowest deck number
|
| To help know which it is using when tapping BOTH up and down arrows on the deck are lit. As the first tap doesn't make any changes (you 
 can't work out a bpm from one tap) it is safe to tap and hold the button and check which deck the arrows are showing on.
|
| MixtrackPlatinumFX.tapChangesTempo to false, recommended only for advanced users. The pads are for controlling cues, loops, and
 samples via various modes & layers. To select a mode, select a Pad Mode button (Cue, Auto Loop, Fader Cuts & Sample) to assign that
 functionality to the 8 pads. An LED under the pad section indicates the currently selected
